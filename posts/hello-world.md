Welcome to my blog! This is my first post ever. I don't think nobody will read it, and I hope so. This is a way to force myself to pause and reflect, at least once a month.

## Sooooooo... what?

As this is the first post, and 2025 just started, I think the most sensible thing to do is start drawing a picture of where I am.

Things that have happened:
- 3 months ago I launched Get-Invoice.com, a B2B SaaS for expense invoice management
- A year ago I launched ArbiChat.com, a Telegram service for arbitrage sports-betting
- A year ago I also left Ucademy.com, a B2C online exam preparation service in Spain
- Less than a year ago, I traveled for 3 months Thailand and Vietnam with my girlfriend
- Next week I have the CFA Level 1 exam, wish me luck
\
So, after leaving Ucademy, a 50 people company we founded with Pablo and Ramiro, I obviously was so fucking lost. But, I wanted to explore other sectors, get more specific knowledge, basically get lost for some time.

At Ucademy I was leading the product team, but also touched some finance at the end. So the first thing I did when I left was to start reading about finance / investing a lot, so I signed up for the CFA exam to force myself to keep studying.

Also, I picked up coding again (if I ever did code). That's when I developed ArbiChat, not a very complex program, but with time I got more interested in web development and that's when I had the idea of starting GetInvoice.

GetInvoice came from a problem we had at Ucademy, which was basically getting all invoices and receipts every month from all people in the org and from portals like Amazon, Google Ads, ... which was a big headache.

Right now, ArbiChat is bringing around $5k revenue per month (like $100 after tax here in Spain), and GetInvoice brings $50 haha. I'm having some trouble with B2B marketing, but we'll figure it out.

## What's Next

One of the things I miss about working with a team is constantly having new inputs, which by working alone is a very difficult thing to do - thinking out of the box. So, this year, I would like to incorporate at least 2 people to my team, from currently 0 people (if business allows me to, I don't want to (can't?) raise money).

More things I'd like to accomplish this year are:
- Do at least 150 gym days (~3 per week)
- Get to $50k MRR with GetInvoice
- Prepare for the CFA Level II exam
- Get a motorbike license
- (Maybe) sell ArbiChat

I would also like to travel to the USA, post at least 12 times on this blog and buy a bookshelf for my office (yea, they're not cheap).\
That's all for January. Thanks for your support :)

This is a pic of me in Thailand. Enjoy your day!
